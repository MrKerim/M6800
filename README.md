<h1 align="center">M6800 Assembly Simulator</h1>
This project is designed for the Yeditepe University students, which are taking the course **CSE232** .
<br></br>
The project is based on the original [paper]("./6800_Instruction_sheet.pdf") and a third party [software](http://www.hvrsoftware.com/6800emu.htm#specs) that simulates the M6800.
<br></br>
Problem is that, the software was the only resource that is provided by the course and there is (currently) no other sowftware/site that simulates the desired assembler. Therefore this project is published to resolve that issue.
<br></br>
Currently live on [here]("http://m6800.vercel.app")
